This is the first project for actually applying the techniques I learned through the TOP curriculum thus far. 
It's been quite challenging, for there really is no actual progress in just looking at how things work. Here, I had to rely on my instincts and use the 
Internet as my guide in need, just as the dev tools. 
I certainly got my feet wet when it comes to slight frustration and actual building. Great project!
